* Freescale Linflex UART

Required properties:
- compatible :
  - "fsl,s32v234-linflex" for linflex configured in uart mode which
  is compatible with the one integrated on S32V234 SoC
- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should contain uart interrupt
- clocks : phandle + clock specifier pairs, one for each entry in clock-names
- clock-names : should contain: "lin" - the uart clock

Example:
uart0:serial@40053000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-linflexuart";
	reg = <0x0 0x40053000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 59 4>;
	clocks = <&clks	S32V234_CLK_LIN>;
	clock-names = "lin";
	status = "disabled";
};
