PRU Core on TI SoCs
===================

Each PRUSS has dual PRU cores, each represented by a PRU node. Each PRU core
has a dedicated Instruction RAM, Control and Debug register sets, and use
the Data RAMs present within the PRUSS for code execution.

Each PRU core node should be defined as a child node of the corresponding PRUSS
node. Each node can optionally be rendered inactive by using the standard DT
string property, "status".

Please see the overall PRUSS bindings document for additional details
including a complete example,
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/ti,pruss.txt

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be
                       "ti,am3356-pru" for AM335x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am4376-pru" for AM437x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am5728-pru" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                       "ti,k2g-pru" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
- reg            : base address and size for each of the 3 sub-module address
                   spaces as mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as
                   the reg-names
- reg-names      : should contain each of the following 3 names, the binding is
                   agnostic of the order of these reg-names, preferable to have
                   the "iram" entry as the first one
                       "iram" for Instruction RAM,
                       "control" for the CTRL sub-module registers,
                       "debug" for the Debug sub-module registers,
- firmware-name  : should contain the name of the default firmware image file
                   located on the firmware search path
