Reset Generation Module (MC_RGM)

The reset generation module (MC_RGM) centralizes the different
reset sources and manages the reset sequence of the chip. It
provides a register interface and the reset sequencer. Various
registers are available to monitor and control the chip reset
sequence. The reset sequencer is a state machine which controls
the different phases (PHASE0, PHASE1, PHASE2, PHASE3, and IDLE)
of the reset sequence and controls the reset signals generated
in the system.
===========================================

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,s32v234-mc_rgm"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet

example:

mc_rgm: mc_rgm@40048000 {
				compatible = "fsl,s32v234-mc_rgm";
				reg = <0x0 0x40048000 0x0 0x1000>;
			};
