Freescale PIT timer used as clocksource/clockevents

This PIT timer driver is designed to be used as clocksource/clockevents
for VF610 and S32V234 SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,s32v234-pit", "fsl,vf610-pit"
- reg : Should contain 1 register ranges(address and length)
- interrupts : One interrupt for PIT timer
- core: The core which will use the timer as
	clockevents generator.

Example:

pit0: pit@4003A000{
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-pit";
	reg = <0x0 0x4003A000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts= <0 31 0xf08>;
	clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_SYS6>;
	clock-names = "pit";
	core = <0>;
	status = "disabled";
};

&pit0 {
	status = "okay";
};
