Freescale STM timer used as clockevents

This STM timer driver is designed to be used as clockevents
for S32V234 SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,s32v234-stm"
- reg : Should contain 1 register range(address and length)
- interrupts : One interrupt for STM timer
- cpu: The virtual cpu id which will use the timer as
	clockevents generator.

Example:

stm0: stm@4000D000{
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-stm";
	reg = <0x0 0x4000D000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts= <0 19 4>;
	clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_SYS6>;
	clock-names = "stm";
	cpu = <1>;
	status = "disabled";
};

&stm0 {
	status = "okay";
};
