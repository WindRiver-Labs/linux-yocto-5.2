* NXP Reserved Shared Memory regions *

Shared reserved memory is specified as a node under the /reserved-memory node.
The operating system shall exclude reserved memory from normal usage
one can create child nodes describing particular reserved (excluded from
normal use) memory regions. Such memory regions are usually designed for
the special usage by various device drivers.
tese nodes can be referenced from other nodes.

Required properties:
- compatible:
  - "fsl,s32v234-shm", for S32V234 SoCs
  - "fsl,s32gen1-shm", for S32Gen1 SoCs
- reg: base address and length of the shared mem block

Example:

  reserved-memory {
    #address-cells = <2>;
    #size-cells = <2>;
    ranges;

    /* 4Mb shared memory for PCIe shared mem transfers, EP mode */
    pci_shared_memory: shm@0xc0000000 {
      compatible = "fsl,s32gen1-shm";
      reg = <0x0 0xc0000000 0x0 0x400000>;    /* 4 MB */
      no-map;
    };
  };
