Vivante GC3000 Graphics Processing Unit

Required properties:
- compatible: "fsl,s32v234-gpu"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers,
       then the start of physical RAM addresses to be used by the GPU.
- interrupts: Must contain an entry for the GPU interrupt
- pu-supply: regulator for supply voltage.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - gpu3d_clk
  - gpu3d_shader_clk
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - gpu3d

Example:

	gpu: gpu@40020000 {
		compatible = "fsl,s32v234-gpu";
		reg = <0x0 0x40020000 0x0 0x1000>,
			  <0x0 0xC0000000 0x0 0x0>;
		reg-names = "iobase_3d", "phys_baseaddr";
		interrupts = <0 101 0x04>;
		interrupt-names = "irq_3d";
		clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_GPU>,
				 <&clks S32V234_CLK_GPU_SHD>;
		clock-names = "gpu3d_clk", "gpu3d_shader_clk";
		resets = <&src 0>;
		reset-names = "gpu3d";
		pu-supply = <&pu_dummy>; /* ldo-bypass:use pu_dummy
							  if VDDSOC share with VDDPU */
	};
