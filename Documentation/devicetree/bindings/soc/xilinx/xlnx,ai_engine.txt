Xilinx AI Engine
----------------

The Xilinx AI Engine is a tile processor with many cores (up to 400) that
can run in parallel. The data routing between cores is configured through
internal switches, and shim tiles interface with external interconnect, such
as memory or PL.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,ai_engine".
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

Example:

	ai_engine@80000000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,ai_engine";
		reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x20000000>;
	};
