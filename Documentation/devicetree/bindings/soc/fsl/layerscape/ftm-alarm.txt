Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "fsl,ftm-alarm" or "fsl,<chip>-ftm-alarm", the
	       supported chips include
	       "fsl,ls1012a-ftm-alarm"
	       "fsl,ls1021a-ftm-alarm"
	       "fsl,ls1043a-ftm-alarm"
	       "fsl,ls1046a-ftm-alarm"
	       "fsl,ls1088a-ftm-alarm"
	       "fsl,ls208xa-ftm-alarm"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the register sets for the
  FlexTimer Module and base physical address of IP Powerdown Exception Control
  Register.
- reg-names: names of the mapped memory regions listed in regs property.
  should include the following entries:
  "ftm":    Address of the register sets for FlexTimer Module
  "pmctrl": Address of IP Powerdown Exception Control register
- interrupts : Should be the FlexTimer Module interrupt.
- big-endian: If the host controller is big-endian mode, specify this property.
  The default endian mode is little-endian.

Example:
ftm0: ftm0@29d0000 {
	compatible = "fsl,ls1043a-ftm-alarm";
	reg = <0x0 0x29d0000 0x0 0x10000>,
	      <0x0 0x1ee2140 0x0 0x4>;
	reg-names = "ftm", "pmctrl";
	interrupts = <0 86 0x4>;
	big-endian;
};
