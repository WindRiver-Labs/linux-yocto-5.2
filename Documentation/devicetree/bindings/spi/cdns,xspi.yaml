title: Cadence XSPI Controller

description: |
  The XSPI controller allows SPI protocol communication in
  single, dual, quad or octal wire transmission modes for
  read/write access to slaves such as SPI-NOR flash.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: cdns,xspi-nor-fpga

  reg:
    maxItems: 3
    description: |
      Contains three entries, each of which is a tuple consisting of a
      physical address and length. The first entry is the address and
      length of the controller register set. The second entry is the
      address and length of the Slave DMA data port. The third entry is
      the address and length of auxiliary registers.

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1

  cdns,dqs-last-data-drop:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This parameter should be set when the Flash Device being used
      issues data on negative edge of Flash clock and returns them with
      DQS and the PHY is configured to sample data in DQS mode.
      If this param is set the controller internally requests this redundant
      data at the end of the transfer cleaning up the PHY FIFO.

  cdns,phy-data-select-oe-start:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Adjusts the starting point of the DQ pad output enable window.
      Lower numbers pull the rising edge earlier in time and larger
      numbers cause the rising edge to be delayed. Each bit changes
      the output enable time by a 1/2 cycle resolution.

  cdns,phy-data-select-oe-end:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Adjusts the ending point of the DQ pad output enable window.
      Lower numbers pull the falling edge earlier in time and larger
      numbers cause the falling edge to be delayed. Each bit changes
      the output enable time by a 1/2 cycle resolution.

  cdns,phy-dqs-select-oe-start:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Adjusts the starting point of the DQS pad output enable window.
      Lower numbers pull the rising edge earlier in time and larger
      numbers cause the rising edge to be delayed. Each bit changes
      the output enable time by a 1/2 cycle resolution.

  cdns,phy-dqs-select-oe-end:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Adjusts the ending point of the DQS pad output enable window.
      Lower numbers pull the falling edge earlier in time and larger
      numbers cause the falling edge to be delayed. Each bit changes
      the output enable time by a 1/2 cycle resolution.

  cdns,phy-gate-cfg-close:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Normally the gate is closing then all bits of dfi_cebar are high
      or when dfi_rd_pre_post_amble and rebar_dfi are high. This parameter
      allows to extend the closing of the DQS gate. Recommended zero.

  cdns,phy-gate-cfg:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Coarse adjust of gate open time. This value is the number of cycles
      to delay the dfi_rddata_en signal prior to opening the gate in
      full cycle increments. Decreasing this value pulls the gate earlier
      in time. This field should be programmed such that the gate signal
      lands in the valid DQS gate window.

  cdns,phy-rd-del-select:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Defines the read data delay. Holds the number of cycles to delay
      the dfi_rddata_en signal prior to enabling the read FIFO.
      After this delay, the read pointers begin incrementing the read FIFO.

  cdns,phy-clk-wr-delay:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Controls the clk_wr delay line which adjusts the write DQ bit
      timing in 1/256th steps of the clock period in normal DLL
      locked mode. In bypass mode this field directly programs
      the number of delay elements.

  cdns,phy-use-lpbk-dqs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This parameter chooses lpbk_dqs to capture data for reads.
      Instead memory DQS will be used.

  cdns,phy-use-ext-lpbk-dqs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This parameter chooses external lpbk_dqs for data capture
      (lpbk_dqs connected to the lpbk_dqs_IO pad). When not used
      mem_rebar_pad is used for data read capture.
