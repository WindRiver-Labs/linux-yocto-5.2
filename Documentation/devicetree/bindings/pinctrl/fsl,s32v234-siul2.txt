* Freescale SIUL2 iomux controller

Based on fsl,imx-pincontrol implementation.

Required properties:
- compatible: "fsl,siul2-pinctrl"
- fsl,pins: two integers array, represents a group of pins mux and config
  setting. The format is fsl,pins = <PIN_FUNC_ID CONFIG>
  PIN_FUNC_ID - id of MSCR to be modified
  CONFIG - configuration to be written in the MSCR/IMCR register

  Even though IMCR register should be used as input register, it can be
  set and addressed in the same way as MSCR, only instead of passing the
  IMCR index, IMCR_IDX + 512 is passed.

  Refer to s32v234-pinfunc.h in device tree source folder for all
  available s32v234 PIN_FUNC_IDS.
