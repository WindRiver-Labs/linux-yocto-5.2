* NXP S32-Gen1 GPR Model

The SoC has a dedicated set of Cluster GPR (General Purpose Registers)
modules for the A53 cores.
These registers provide cluster and core level configurations
as well as event generation mechanisms.
Other cores may also have dedicated Cluster GPR modules
(e.g. the Cortex M7 cores).

Required properties:
- compatible:
	Should be:
	- "fsl,s32gen1-a53gpr" for the A53 clusters
- reg:
	Location and length of the register set

Example:

a53_gpr: a53_gpr@4007C400 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32gen1-a53gpr";
	reg = <0x0 0x4007C400 0x0 0x100>;
};
