S32V234 Shared Memory Block

This is a shared memory block to be used by various S32V234 generic devices,
which require a dedicated contiguous memory block to be reserved in the kernel
memory space.

It must reside inside the 'reserved-memory' section of the device tree.
device is matched via its bus drivers, and has a number of properties
that apply in on the generic device (independent from the bus).
It may be used by more than one device at once, as long as each one follows
a proper synchronization mechanism for accessing the data.

Required properties:
 - compatible: 		should be set to "fsl,s32v234-shm"
 - reg:			the address range

address (@<address>) should be appended to the name.

Any device requiring access to this shared memory block should reference it
from its own device tree node.

Example:

reserved-memory {
	....
	/* 1Mb shared memory */
	shared_memory: shm@0xC1000000 {
		compatible = "fsl,s32v234-shm";
		reg = <0x0 0xC1000000 0x0 0x100000>;    /* 1 MB */
		no-map;
	};
};

....

some-device {
	....
	memory-region = <&shared_memory>;
};
