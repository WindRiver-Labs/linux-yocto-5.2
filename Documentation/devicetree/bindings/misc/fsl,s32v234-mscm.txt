Simple iomem memory block containing the mapping of the address space
of the Miscellaneous System Control Module (MSCM).
For S32V234 this module occupies a 4 Kb address space.

Required properties:

- compatible : fsl,s32v234-mscm

- reg : the address range

- interrupts : the interrupts managed by registers in this module
	(e.g. the CPU 2 CPU directed interrupts)

address (@<address>) should be
appended to the name.

Example:

mscm1: mscm@40081000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-mscm";

	reg = <0x0 0x40081000 0x0 0x1000>;

	/* CPU2CPU interrupts */
	interrupts = <0 0 4 >,
			<0 1 4 >,
			<0 2 4 >,
			<0 3 4 >;
};
