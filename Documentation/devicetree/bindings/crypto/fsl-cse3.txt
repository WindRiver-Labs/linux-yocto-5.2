Freescale CSE3 Cryptographic Services Engine included in some chips.
Currently only S32V234 is supported.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "fsl,<soc>-cse3"
- reg : Should contain CSE3 registers location and length
- interrupts : Should contain CSE3 interrupt number

Example:

cse3: crypto@40001000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-cse3";
	reg = <0x0 0x40001000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 18 4>;
	status = "disabled";
};
