Freescale MIPI-CSI2 interface

Describes camera serial interface configuration.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,<chip>-mipicsi2", chip should be s32v234
- reg : Should contain the mipicsi2 register range (address and length - both
		64bit)

Required nodes:
- sensor: Phandle to a sensor node placed in corresponding I2C bus.
	Additional, the sensor node has to define properties:
	- compatible: "fsl,<chip>-mipicsi2", chip should be s32v234
	- reg: address of the device on i2c bus (without r/w bit)
	- init_mode: string description of the image mode to be configured by default.
			String format: "<width>x<height>x<pixel_format>".
			Unsupported strings will be ignored.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
		See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
	- mipicsi2

Pinmuxing note:
- Connected sensor might require specific pin muxing setup. Corresponding
	entries have to be added to s32v234-evb.dts and defined in:
	include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/s32v234-pinctrl.h and
	drivers/pinctrl/freescale/pinctrl-s32v234.c.

Example:
aips0: aips-bus@40000000 {

	...

	mipicsi0: mipicsi2@40030000{
		compatible = "fsl,s32v234-mipicsi2";
		reg = <0x0 0x40030000 0x0 0x1000>;
		sensor = <0x0>; //<&sony_cam>;
		clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_SYS6>;
		clock-names = "mipicsi2";

		status = "disabled";
	};

	...

	i2c0: i2c@40051000 {
		// sony camera
		sony_cam: sensor@1a {
			compatible = "sony,imx224mqv";
			reg = <0x1a>;
			init_mode = "1280x720xRAW12";
		};
	};
};
