NXP Layerscpae ls1028a HDP-TX PHY Controller
============================================

The following bindings describe the Cadence HDP TX PHY on ls1028a that
offer multi-protocol support of standars such as eDP and Displayport,
supports for 25-600MHz pixel clock and up to 4k2k at 60MHz resolution.
The HDP transmitter is a Cadence HDP TX controller IP with a companion
PHY IP.

Required properties:
  - compatible:   Should be "fsl,ls1028a-dp" for ls1028a.
  - reg:          Physical base address and size of the block of registers used
  by the processor.
  - interrupts:   HDP hotplug in/out detect interrupt number
  - clocks:       A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
  in 'clock-names'
  - clock-names:  A list of clock names. It should contain:
      - "clk_ipg": inter-Integrated circuit clock
      - "clk_core": for the Main Display TX controller clock
      - "clk_pxl": for the pixel clock feeding the output PLL of the processor
      - "clk_pxl_mux": for the high PerfPLL bypass clock
      - "clk_pxl_link": for the link rate pixel clock
      - "clk_apb": for the APB interface clock
      - "clk_vif": for the Video pixel clock

Required sub-nodes:
  - port: The HDP connection to an encoder output port. The connection
    is modelled using the OF graph bindings specified in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt


Example:

/ {
        ...

        display1: hdp@f200000 {
                compatible = "fsl,ls1028a-dp";
		reg = <0x0 0xf1f0000 0x0 0xffff>,
		    <0x0 0xf200000 0x0 0xfffff>;
                interrupts = <0 221 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&sysclk>, <&hdpclk>, <&dpclk>,
                         <&dpclk>, <&dpclk>, <&pclk>, <&dpclk>;
		clock-names = "clk_ipg", "clk_core", "clk_pxl",
                              "clk_pxl_mux", "clk_pxl_link", "clk_apb",
                              "clk_vif";

		port {
			dp1_output: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dp0_input>;
			};
		};
        };

        ...
};
