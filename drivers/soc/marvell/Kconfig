config OCTEONTX2_RM
	tristate "OcteonTX2 RVU Resource Manager driver"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_AF
	help
	  This driver offers resource management interfaces for Marvell's
	  OcteonTX2 Resource Virtualization Unit SSO/TIM PFs which are used
	  for interfacing with non-NIC hardware offload units.

config OCTEONTX2_RM_DOM_SYSFS
	bool "OcteonTX2 RVU Resource Manager domain sysfs"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_RM
	help
	  Enable Application Domain sysfs which simplifies management of
	  SSO/TIM VFs and OcteonTX2 RVU based NIC devices by the system
	  administrator. This interface consists of the following files:

	  I. /sys/bus/pci/drivers/octeontx2-rm/0*/create_domain

	  Writing to this file will:
	  1. Create a domain directory in /sys/bus/pci/drivers/octeontx2-rm/0*
	     with the domain name
	  2. Reserve one of SSO/TIM VFs for this domain and set its limits
	     according to the specification passed in write string
	  3. Create symlinks to all devices that will be part of the domain
	     in the directory created in point 1
	  4. Create domain_id file returning the ID assigned to this domain
	     (effectively the domain name)
	  5. Create domain_in_use file which reports state of domain's
	     SSO/TIM device's in_use file to indicate when domain is used
	     by an application.

	  The syntax for writing into this file is:

	      name;param:val(;param:val)*

	  * name - domain name
	  * param - parameter name, based on the parameter, its value 'val'
	    has to have a different format:
	    * sso, ssow, npa, tim, cpt - 'val' is an integer value of the
	      number of LFs to assign to the domain
	    * port - 'val' is in 'DDDD:BB:DD.F' format and specifies device
	      representing a port.

	  There are the following rules when creating a domain:

	  1. Domain names must be unique
	  2. Each domain must have at least 1 NPA and 1 SSOW LF
	  3. One port may be only assigned to a single domain

	  II. /sys/bus/pci/drivers/octeontx2-rm/0*/destroy_domain

	  Writing domain name to this file will cause given domain to be
	  removed from the sysfs. This includes:
	  1. Setting all limits of domain's SSO/TIM device to 0
	  2. Removing all sysfs structures for this domain
	  3. Removing all ports in this application domain from the list of
	     ports in use.

	  Removal of the domain is disabled while domain is in use, that
	  is while the 'in_use' flag of the domain's SSO/TIM device is set.
	  User/admin may query the status of this flag using the
	  'domain_in_use'  file in the domain's sysfs directory.

config OCTEONTX2_DPI_PF
	tristate "OcteonTX2 DPI-DMA PF driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI
	help
	  Select this option to enable DPI PF driver support.
	  DPI (DMA packet interface) provides DMA support for MAC.
	  This driver intializes dpi PF device and enables VF's for supporting
	  different types of DMA transfers.

config OCTEONTX2_SDP_PF
	tristate "OcteonTX2 SDP PF driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI && OCTEONTX2_AF && OCTEONTX2_MBOX
	default y
	---help---
	  Select this option to enable SDP PF driver support.

config OCTEONTX2_NPA_PF
	tristate "OcteonTX2 NPA PF driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI && OCTEONTX2_AF && OCTEONTX2_MBOX
	default m
	help
	  Select this option to enable NPA PF driver support.

	  NPA stands for Network Pool Allocator. This is a hardware unit on
	  OCTEONTX2 that can maintain pools of buffer pointers. Either software
	  or any other hardware can allocate and free pointers to buffer pools
	  maintained by NPA.

config GTI_WATCHDOG
	tristate "GTI Watchdog driver"
	depends on ARM64
	---help---
	GTI Watchdog driver, provides ioctl's for applications to
	setup and enable the NMI Watchdog and also provides
	an mmap() interface to map GTI device memory into process
	address space for the application to directly poke the
	GTI watchdog without any kernel support and entry.

config OCTEONTX2_LLC
	bool "OcteonTX2 LLC Manager driver"
	depends on ARM64
	default y
	help
	  This driver offers cache management interface for
	  Marvell's OcteonTX2 LLC cache Lock and Unlock operations.

config OCTEONTX_INFO
       tristate "OcteonTX Info driver"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help
	provides procfs interface to board information like board name, board revision
	mac addresses, board serial number and more. These are boards housing Marvell
	OcteonTX family chipsets.

config MVMDIO_UIO
	tristate "Marvell MDIO interface driver"
	  default m
	select MDIO_THUNDER
	help
	  Select this option if you want to provide an interface for userspace
	  PHY drivers to access Marvell's MDIO bus.

config HW_CSR_ACCESS
       tristate "Access HW Device Config Space Registers"
        default m
	help
	  provides an interface which enables user space utility to read from or to write
	  to HW Device Config Space Registers.
